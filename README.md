# BoadwayScraper

For the code to run, please create a directory called assignment_6_starter_files, with the files in the proper folders. Otherwise, change the imports at the top of the two main dags. The dags are titled: musicals.py, and broadway_pipeline_dag.py. The data outputs have also been put in this repo.
